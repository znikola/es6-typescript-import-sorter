TODO:

To check in `package.json`:

- entry point: (index.js). This is `main` property. In VScode's repo it's pointing to `out` (similar to Angular's `dist`) directory
- test command: [which framework to use for testing?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44879644/what-is-the-test-command-while-creating-package-json)
- add other script's, i.e. "watch": "tsc -watch -p ./", "compile": "tsc -p ./"
